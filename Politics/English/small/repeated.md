First of all, compared with Westerners, the Chinese people have traditionally paid more attention to the harmonious relationship between human beings and nature. "Nature and Man are one" is a familiar statement in traditional Chinese ideology. In addition, in Chinese traditional thought, much emphasis is laid upon moral cultivation, the refinement of temper, and the spiritual enlightenment on the part of individual rather than upon logical reasoning.

### 还缺一个抱歉信


### 7.建议信 你教授让你计划一个关于城市交通的讨论赛，给他建议一个话题，并且告诉他你的理由  还要告诉他你的安排比如什么时候举办啊之类的
> - It is my great pleasure to plan a debate on the theme of city traffic. My suggested topic is: "Private Cars--A Blessing or a Curse?"
> - The primary reasons for my suggestion are as follows. On the one hand, some claim that there are many advantages to possessing a car. It gives a much greater degree of comfort and mobility. On the other hand, others strongly object to owning private cars. They maintain that private cars contribute to traffic congestion so greatly that the advantages gained in comfort and freedom are often cancelled out by the frustration caused by traffic jams.
> - The debate has been arranged for December 22 in the Students' Recreational Center. I am looking forward to your reply.

His words and life story were recorded by his disciples and their students in The Analects. As an enduring classic of ancient Chinese culture. The Analects has influenced all thinkers. writers and politicians in the over-2000. year-long history of China after Confucius. No scholar could truely understand this long- standing culture or the inner world of the ancient Chinese without this book.
